For the first six problems, I solved the problem by looking through slides
posted by the TA and examples that we went over during discussion. I found
those very help. The problems were a bit challenging in that as I never 
before coded in ocaml, it took some time to get used to the syntax and way
of thinking. I spent the most time solving problem 7, which is to remove
unreachable grammar rules. I knew that I had to parse the given input into 
many different chunks, but it was difficult to do that in ocaml as we can't 
use loops. So, I had to use different recursive helper functions to extract
information that I need from the given grammar. As I am used to using loops,
having to use recursion for every function was challenging. Problem 7 became
easier to solve after I realize to use the set functions I already previously
wrote. I found problems easier to solve after splitting them up into smaller
subproblems.
